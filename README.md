# webex-quotes
Fill the CustomMessage section of the screen with a random quote

When running this macro on a WebEx Deskpro (or other compatible devices),
a quote will be pulled from a public quote server and displayed on the
bottom left corner of the WebEx device.

Just select "Import from File" to add the javascript macro to your WebEx endpoint.

If you want to run this on a server, take a look at the Python script. That
requires login access to the WebEx device.
